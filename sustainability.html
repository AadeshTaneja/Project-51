            Our organization's endeavour to create a culture of safety, health and environment saw a new light with the implementation of Change Agents for Safety, Health and workplace Environment (CASHe). This project has garnered enough strength to make safety and health a priority in the workplace, and improved occupational safety and health significantly.
